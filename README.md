This is an Alien World, project titled "Alien Convexity"
...
Alien Convexity is a 2D real world, say, Alien World, where characters, beings, and yourself, all have the opportunity to hunt and gather what you need the most in order to survive!
...
During the beginning of May 2025, I will start crafting this world with a main character in mind, YOU!
You are the Avatar. We'll first create the initial map of this Alien World, we call it "Emerald", a land where emerald diamonds are scattered everywhere, among other things.
.
You can consider a map as an island, isolated from other maps, however, know that what happens on an island may affect the outcome of things on other islands!
...
Throughout my journey in creating this Alien World, I will be allowing Avatar unique abilities that let him circumnavigate this Alien World--as well as beings that he will encounter along the way.
...
I've yet to decide the journey Avatar will take, however, I will be incorporating rival AI agents with path finding abilities that you, the Avatar, will need to defeat. 
...
There will be fun games your Avatar can partake in as well, sort of like an homage to some classics of the 20th century.
...
The journey begins!
